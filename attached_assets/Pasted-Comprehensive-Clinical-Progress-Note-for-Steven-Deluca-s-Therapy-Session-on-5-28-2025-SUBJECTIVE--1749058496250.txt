Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note for Steven Deluca's Therapy Session on 5/28/2025

**SUBJECTIVE SECTION:**
Steven presented today with significant interpersonal distress centered around complex friendship dynamics and trust issues. He reported a recent conflict with his friend Mark that began over the weekend when he experienced an intense intuitive feeling: "I'm driving home. I'm literally about to turn the corner to my house, and something literally comes over me. I felt it in my gut. It said, drive fastest. Kids house." This gut instinct led him to discover that Mark and Walter had gone to a bar without inviting Steven and Diana.

Steven described feeling betrayed by the secretive nature of this outing: "I'm unsettled by the secrecy, and you're avoiding my questions." He confronted Mark through extensive text messaging, expressing intense emotional reactions: "I would rather drop dead tonight than go there and talk to you about the weather, let alone this. I don't like how you're moving. It's bothering the fire." Steven's language reveals the depth of his emotional response to perceived betrayal and exclusion.

The client reported persistent suspicions about Mark's relationship with Walter: "I feel like you're lying. I feel like something happened between the two you and Nashville. I feel like you like, hooked up." Despite Mark's denials, Steven maintained his disbelief: "I said, I don't know. It just feels weird to me." This demonstrates ongoing trust issues that extend beyond the immediate incident.

Steven also discussed a separate interpersonal situation involving a coworker also named Walter, describing boundary violations during a night out: "I don't know, I got really drunk, and we were making out, whatever it happens. We moved on. We never talked about it again." He reported that this Walter has since referred to Steven as his boyfriend and engaged in physical contact, creating ambivalence about the developing relationship.
