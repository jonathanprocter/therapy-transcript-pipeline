Thanks for pointing out that pdf-lib error in export. ts! That's very
helpful. It seems my last update was a bit off, and the OpenAl error
was the one I was trying to fix. I'll make sure to address the pdf-lib
color format issue in export. ts after I confirm the fix for the OpenAl
SDK usage in analyze-emotions.ts. It's good to have the next
error already identified!
I'm currently updating the OpenAl SDK usage in analyze-
emotions.ts. Once that's done, I'll address the pdf-lib color issue
in export. ts that you pointed out. Thanks again for spotting that!

no problem, please continue
Today 18:15

Will do!

Crafting a response and working on
Attempt to fix the Next.js build errors.
Analyze the project structure, particularly how Next.js app and pages directories are used.
• Ensure _app. tsx and_document. tsx (or their equivalents in the App Router) are correctly set up if
Pages Router features are being used, or ensure they are not being incorrectly imported/referenced if
it's purely an App Router setup.
• The worker may need to check for common causes like ensuring next is a direct dependency,
potentially reinstalling next and react, or cleaning node_modules and reinstalling.
• The goal is to get pm run build to complete successfully.
